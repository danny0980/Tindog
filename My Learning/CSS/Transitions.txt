CSS Transitions

CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration.

Example: Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect:

Browser Support for Transitions

The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the property.

Numbers followed by -webkit-, -moz-, or -o- specify the first version that worked with a prefix.

How to Use CSS Transitions?

To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

    the CSS property you want to add an effect to
    the duration of the effect

Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

The following example shows a 100px * 100px red <div> element. The <div> element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:
Example
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  -webkit-transition: width 2s; /* Safari */
  transition: width 2s;
}

The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value.

Now, let us specify a new value for the width property when a user mouses over the <div> element:
Example
div:hover {
  width: 300px;
}

Notice that when the cursor mouses out of the element, it will gradually change back to its original style.
Change Several Property Values

The following example adds a transition effect for both the width and height property, with a duration of 2 seconds for the width and 4 seconds for the height:
Example
div {
  -webkit-transition: width 2s, height 4s; /* Safari */
  transition: width 2s, height 4s;
}
Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

    ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
    ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
    ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
    ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

The following example shows the some of the different speed curves that can be used:
Example
#div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;}
#div2 {transition-timing-function: ease;}
#div3 {transition-timing-function: ease-in;}
#div4 {transition-timing-function: ease-out;}
#div5 {transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;}
Delay the Transition Effect

The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.

The following example has a 1 second delay before starting:
Example
div {
  -webkit-transition-delay: 1s; /* Safari */
  transition-delay: 1s;
}
Transition + Transformation

The following example also adds a transformation to the transition effect:
Example
div {
  -webkit-transition: width 2s, height 2s, -webkit-transform 2s; /* Safari */
  transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;
}
More Transition Examples

The CSS transition properties can be specified one by one, like this:
Example
div {
  transition-property: width;
  transition-duration: 2s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
  transition-delay: 1s;
}

or by using the shorthand property transition:
Example
div {
  transition: width 2s linear 1s;
} 

CSS Transition Properties

The following table lists all the CSS transition properties:
Property 	                            Description
transition 	               A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
transition-delay 	       Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
transition-duration 	       Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete
transition-property 	        Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for
transition-timing-function 	Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
