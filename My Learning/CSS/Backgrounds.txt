Backgrounds



The CSS background properties are used to define the background effects for elements.

CSS background properties:

    background-color
    background-image
    background-repeat
    background-attachment
    background-position

Background Color

The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

The background color of a page is set like this:
Example
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
} 

With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

    a valid color name - like "red"
    a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
    an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

In the example below, the <h1>, <p>, and <div> elements have different background colors:
Example
h1 {
  background-color: green;
}

div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: yellow;
} 

Background Image

The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

The background image for a page can be set like this:
Example
body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
} 

Below is an example of a bad combination of text and background image. The text is hardly readable:
Example
body {
  background-image: url("bgdesert.jpg");
} 



Note: When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.
Background Image - Repeat Horizontally or Vertically

By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:
Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
} 

 When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

    background-color
    background-image
    background-repeat
    background-attachment
    background-position

It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.
