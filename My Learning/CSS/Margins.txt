CSS Margins

The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
Margin - Individual Sides

CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

    margin-top
    margin-right
    margin-bottom
    margin-left

All the margin properties can have the following values:

    auto - the browser calculates the margin
    length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
    % - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
    inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

Tip: Negative values are allowed.

The following example sets different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:
Example
p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
} 

Margin - Shorthand Property

To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.

The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:

    margin-top
    margin-right
    margin-bottom
    margin-left

So, here is how it works:

If the margin property has four values:

    margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
        top margin is 25px
        right margin is 50px
        bottom margin is 75px
        left margin is 100px

Example
p {
  margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
} 

The auto Value

You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins:
Example
div {
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 1px solid red;
} 

The auto Value

You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins:
Example
div {
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 1px solid red;
} 

The inherit Value

This example lets the left margin of the <p class="ex1"> element be inherited from the parent element (<div>):
Example
div {
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin-left: 100px;
}

p.ex1 {
  margin-left: inherit;
}
